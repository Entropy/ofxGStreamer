ofxGStreamer
============

openFrameworks addon to use gstreamer under osx and windows. This addon has no code and instead uses the addon_config.mk file to add the needed files from the core + the flags needed to compile using gstreamer

This will only work with the latest version of the project generator from github (10/10/2013)

##Installing gstreamer

This addon depends on the gstreamer SDK. To install it:

###osx

You can download gstreamer v1.0. To install it under osx use the packages from (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/osx/1.0.8/)[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/osx/1.0.8/]
    
    - gstreamer-1.0-1.0.8-universal.pkg installs the necesary libraries for applications to run
    
    - gstreamer-1.0-devel-1.0.8-universal.pkg installs the development files needed to compile gst aplications
    
    - gstreamer-1.0-1.0.8-universal-packages.dmg contains some additional packages that are needed to encode some formats like h264, some of this packages have GPL license or use patented formats. From those this package is needed to do colorspace conversion:
    
        - gstreamer-1.0-libav-1.0.8-universal.pkg
    
    And these will provide h264 encoding and some network utils to stream h264 and other formats
        
        - gstreamer-1.0-codecs-restricted-1.0.8-universal.pkg
        
        - gstreamer-1.0-net-restricted-1.0.8-universal.pkg

If we only want to run an osx app. The devel package is not needed but by now we need to install the rest of packages

On some systems it seems it's necesary to remove or rename /Library/Frameworks/GStreamer/Headers/assert.h or it'll clash with the assert.h in the system and some projects won't compile. As far as i've tested it's safe to just delete it but it's probably better to keep a copy just in case.
