ofxGStreamer
============

openFrameworks addon to use gstreamer under osx and windows. This addon has no code and instead uses the addon_config.mk file to add the needed files from the core + the flags needed to compile using gstreamer

This will only work with the latest version of the project generator from github (10/10/2013)
